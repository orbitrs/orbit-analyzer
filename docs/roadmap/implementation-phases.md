# Orlint Implementation Phases

This document outlines the implementation plan for Orbit Analyzer (orlint), detailing the specific features, improvements, and goals across different development phases.

## Current Status - v0.1.x (May 2025)

The current implementation of Orlint includes:

- âœ… Basic syntax validation for `.orbit` files
- âœ… Foundation of linting rules for component quality
- âœ… Core CLI interface for executing analysis
- âœ… Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- âœ… Integration with CI/CD workflows
- âœ… Configurable rule enabling/disabling via `.orlint.toml`

## Phase 1: Foundational Analysis (v0.2) - Target: Q3 2025

This phase focuses on enhancing the core analysis capabilities:

- ğŸ”² Extended rule set for component best practices
  - ğŸ”² Component lifecycle method checks
  - ğŸ”² Event handler naming and usage patterns
  - ğŸ”² Prop validation and required props checks
  - ğŸ”² State initialization and mutation patterns
- ğŸ”² Syntax error recovery for partial analysis of invalid files
- ğŸ”² Enhanced reporting with source code context
- ğŸ”² Rule severity customization
- ğŸ”² Ignore comments to disable specific rules in code
- ğŸ”² JSON reporter for programmatic consumption
- ğŸ”² Performance improvements for large codebases

## Phase 2: Advanced Analysis (v0.3) - Target: Q4 2025

This phase adds more sophisticated analysis capabilities:

- ğŸ”² Inter-component analysis for consistency checks
- ğŸ”² Data flow analysis within components
- ğŸ”² Type checking integration with Rust code
- ğŸ”² Component dependency analysis
- ğŸ”² Renderer-specific optimization suggestions
  - ğŸ”² WGPU-specific checks
  - ğŸ”² Skia-specific checks
- ğŸ”² Performance impact analysis
- ğŸ”² Reusable code pattern recognition
- ğŸ”² Custom rule plugins via external crates
- ğŸ”² HTML report generation

## Phase 3: IDE Integration (v0.4) - Target: Q1 2026

This phase focuses on developer experience improvements:

- ğŸ”² VS Code extension
  - ğŸ”² Real-time linting as you type
  - ğŸ”² Quick fixes for common issues
  - ğŸ”² Code actions for refactoring
- ğŸ”² Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation
  - ğŸ”² Support for multiple editors
  - ğŸ”² Code completion for Orbit components
  - ğŸ”² Hover information
- ğŸ”² Integration with Rust Analyzer
- ğŸ”² Auto-formatting for `.orbit` files
- ğŸ”² Refactoring tools
- ğŸ”² Code generation capabilities

## Phase 4: Community and Ecosystem (v1.0) - Target: Q2 2026

This phase establishes Orlint as a stable, community-driven tool:

- ğŸ”² Community rule repository
- ğŸ”² Rule sharing and discovery mechanism
- ğŸ”² Comprehensive documentation
- ğŸ”² Component performance benchmarks
- ğŸ”² Integration with orbiton CLI workflows
- ğŸ”² Template validation
- ğŸ”² Security analysis
