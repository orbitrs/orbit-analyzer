# CI/CD Workflow Fixes

This document outlines the fixes made to the CI workflow on May 23, 2025, in line with the prioritization of core framework development over SDK improvements.

## Issues Fixed

1. **Workspace Path Issues**
   - Fixed path references for the `orbitrs-workspace` directory
   - Ensured all jobs consistently use the same path structure
   - Added explicit absolute paths with `${{ github.workspace }}` to prevent resolution issues

2. **Code Coverage Configuration**
   - Updated the code coverage job to use the workspace structure
   - Fixed the LCOV file path for Codecov upload
   - Added `ignore_wayland_tests` flag for consistent CI behavior

3. **Cache Configuration**
   - Updated cache paths to use explicit absolute paths
   - Ensured consistent cache configuration across all jobs
   - Added proper target directory references

## Priority Alignment

These fixes are consistent with our development priorities, which focus on core framework development rather than SDK improvements. The CI workflow now:

- Efficiently tests the core functionality
- Ignores non-essential SDK-specific features
- Provides robust code coverage for critical components

## Future Improvements

For future CI enhancements, we should consider:

1. Implementing parallel test execution for faster builds
2. Adding specific tests for core framework components only
3. Optimizing cache usage to further improve build times

## Development Notes

- The current CI focuses on the `orlint` component as part of the core framework
- SDK-specific improvements are considered non-essential
- Core framework development remains the priority for all CI/CD pipelines
